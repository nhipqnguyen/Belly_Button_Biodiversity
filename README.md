# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
# Project Overview
In this project, I used Plotly.js to build a dashboard with interactive charts with a belly button diversity dataset. Upon selection of an ID number in a pull down list, a dashboard with the following visualizations will be displayed:
- A demographic information panel with the selected volunteer's information
- A horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found in the selected volunteer's belly button
- A bubble chart illustrating bacteria cultures per sample of the selected volunteer
- A gauge chart displaying the selected volunteer's weekly washing frequency's value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar.

## Resources
Data Sources: samples.json.

## Results
Below is a screenshot of the dashboard after getting deployed to Git Pages.
